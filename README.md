# BipedLearner_RUC
This is a 4th semester project from Roskilde University spring 2015. This projects consists of a program that experiments
with Q-Learning for a bipedal walker in a 2d-environment using JAVA. 

This was done with using code from AIMA ( https://github.com/aima-java/aima-java )
and the physics library at dyn4j.org . 

The code has been written by Frederik Juutilanen, Sara Daugbjerg and Younes Haroun Bakhti.

You're welcome to that run, alter and modify the code for non-commercial. As long as this is done while adhering
to the licensing rules of dyn4j and AIMA. We'd also like you to include a link to our github page.

Thanks!
